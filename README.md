# TRX token distribution software

Use: to distribute a fixed amount of TOKENS to the voters

## Configuration
Edit config.json and config_snapshot.json and modify the lines with your settings:

- coin: TRX
- ~~token: token name~~
- token: token ID
- sraddress: Super Representative's address
- owneraddress: The addres from where the token payments will be broadcasted
- node: node where you get data
- nodepay: node used for payments. It's recommended to change the nodepay to http://127.0.0.1:9000 after clone and install Rovak's docker containers repo (Please see the details in dependencies section)
- percentage: always 100 - this script distributes a fixed amount of tokens, not a percentage
- amount: total amount of tokens to distribute
- minpayout: the minimum amount for a payout (NOTICE: in config_snapshot.json DO NOT modify minpayout)
- pk: the private key of your address
- saveindb: true if you want to save snapshots in your database
- dbname: name of your database; not needed if saveindb is set to false
- dbuser: user of your database; not needed if saveindb is set to false
- dbpass: password of your database; not needed if saveindb is set to false
- dbhost: localhost; not needed if saveindb is set to false
- donations: a list of object (address: amount) for send static amount every payout
- donationspercentage: a list of object (address: percentage) for send static percentage every payout
- skip: a list of address to skip

Edit poollogs.json and modify the lines with your settings:
- lastpayout: the unixtimestamp of your last payout or the date of pool starting

Edit the following line in votes.js with your SR address:

const CANDIDATE_ADDRESS = '';


### Private pool
If you want to run a private pool, you need to edit config.json and:
- private: set to true
- whitelist: put a list of addresses you wish to include


## Dependencies
```
sudo apt install python3-pip

sudo pip3 install python-dateutil

sudo pip3 install python-dateutil --upgrade

sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

sudo apt-get install build-dep python-psycopg2

sudo pip3 install psycopg2-binary

git clone https://github.com/CryptoGirls/trx-token-pool

cd trx-token-pool

sudo apt install nodejs

sudo apt install npm

npm install axios

- node doesn't work? Install a newer version:

curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

```

If you want to save snapshots in your database, create the following tables in your database:

```
create table voters(
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
voterAddress varchar,
votes float,
votedOn int,
prevDate int,
insertDate int,
toPay float,
snapshotNo int);

create table constants(
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name varchar,
stringValue varchar,
numberValue float,
timestamp timestamp,
prevDate int,
insertDate int,
snapshotNo int);
```

To not send the private key in plain text to the network, it's recommended to install and configure docker containers made by Rovak.

```
apt install docker docker-compose

git clone https://github.com/tronscan/tronscan-docker

```

In docker-compose.yml file put your SR IP in full and solidity IPs:

```
      NODE_FULL_IP: "YOUR_SR_IP_HERE"
      NODE_FULL_PORT: "50051"
      NODE_SOLIDITY_IP: "YOUR_SR_IP_HERE"
      NODE_SOLIDITY_PORT: "50051"
      ENABLE_SYNC: "false"
      ENABLE_NETWORK_SCANNER: "false"
      SECRET_KEY: "aSLtAkzrIY9pTPyboOih"
```

Run it in screen:

```
./start.sh
```

Now you should be able to call the API from http://127.0.0.1:9000

## Running it

1. At the start of each round - 4 times a day

```node votes.js```

2. At the end of each round - 3 times a day (the script will calculate pending amounts)

```python3 trxpool.py -c config_snapshot.json```

3. At the end of the 4th round - once a day (the script will create a file called "payments.sh")

```python3 trxpool.py```

The file "payments.sh" will have all payments shell commands. Run this file with:

```bash payments.sh```

The payments will be broadcasted every second.


## Batch mode

The scripts are also runnable by cron.

- give rights to execute

`chmod +x voters.sh`

`chmod +x trx.sh`

`chmod +x trx24.sh`

- execute the scripts

`./voters.sh`

`./trx.sh`

`./trx24.sh`


## Command line usage

```
usage: trxpool.py [-h] [-c config.json] [-y] [--min-payout MINPAYOUT]

TRX payments script

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c config.json        set a config file (default: config.json)
  -y                    automatic yes for log saving (default: no)
