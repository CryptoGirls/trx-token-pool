### Private pool
If you want to run a private pool, you need to edit config.json and:
- private: set to true
- whitelist: put a list of addresses you wish to include


## Dependecies
```sudo apt install python3-pip```

```sudo pip3 install python-dateutil```

```sudo pip3 install python-dateutil --upgrade```

```sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib```

```sudo apt-get install build-dep python-psycopg2```

```sudo pip3 install psycopg2-binary```

```git clone https://github.com/CryptoGirls/trx-pool```

If you want to save snapshots in your database, run:

```create table voters(
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
voterAddress varchar,
votes float,
votedOn int,
prevDate int,
insertDate int,
toPay float,
snapshotNo int);

create table const(
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name varchar,
stringValue varchar,
numberValue float,
timestamp timestamp,
prevDate int,
insertDate int,
snapshotNo int);```


## Running it

```python3 trxpool.py```

or if you want to use another config file:

```python3 trxpool.py -c config_snapshot.json```

It produces a file "payments.sh" with all payments shell commands. Run this file with:

```bash payments.sh```

The payments will be broadcasted (every second).


## Batch mode

The script is also runnable by cron using the -y argument:

`python3 trxpool.py -y`


### Pay all the voters

Even if you will run the payments daily, because of the 6 hours vote cycle, you can miss to pay some voters that voted for you in the first cycle of the day and they removed their vote. To prevent this, you can follow the next 2 steps:

1. Run the following every hour (no payments will be broadcasted):
```python3 trxpool.py -c config_snapshot.json```

2. Run trxpool.py normally to broadcast the payments
```python3 trxpool.py```


## Command line usage

```
usage: trxpool.py [-h] [-c config.json] [-y] [--min-payout MINPAYOUT]

TRX payments script

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c config.json        set a config file (default: config.json)
  -y                    automatic yes for log saving (default: no)
  --min-payout MINPAYOUT
                        override the minpayout value from config file
```
